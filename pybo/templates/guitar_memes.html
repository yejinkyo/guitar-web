    <h1><b>Memes dictionary</b></h1>
      <p>What is a meme, and what do the most popular memes actually mean? We heard you ask, so we created the ultimate meme dictionary to make sense of it all!</p>

Is there a way to tell who was the very first person to put words on a photo of Chef Gordon Ramsey or turn some lines into a heart rate that spread all over Twitter? Take a look through our meme meanings to find out just where they came from and how long they’ve been around.</p>
